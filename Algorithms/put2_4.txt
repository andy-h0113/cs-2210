put2_4(r,k,o) // O(logn)
Search for k to find the lowest insertion internal node v;
Add new data item (k,o) at node v;
while node v overflows do {
    if v is the root then
	Create a new empty root and set as parent of v;
    Split v around second key k', move k' to parent and
    	update parent's children;
    v = parent of v;
