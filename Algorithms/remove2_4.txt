remove2_4(r,k) // O(logn)
Find the node v storing k using get(k);
Remove (k, o) from v replacing it with successor if need;
while node v underflows do {
    if v is the root then
	make the first child of v the new root
    else if a sibling has at least 2 keys then
 	perform a transfer operation
    else
	perform a fusion operation
	v = parent of v
}
