remove_bt(r,k) //O(d*logdn)
Find the node v storing key k;
Remove(k,o) from v replacing it with successor if need;
while node v underflows do {
    if v is the root then
	make the first child of v the new root;
    else if a sibling has at least [d/2] keys then
	perform a transfer operation;
    else
	perform a fusion operation;
	v = parent of v;
